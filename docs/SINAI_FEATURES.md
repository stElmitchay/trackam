# Sinai Tracker — Feature Brainstorm & Roadmap

> The ultimate internal AI competition platform. Built with SvelteKit + Supabase + Tailwind.
> Meta play: winning Sinai by building the tool that tracks Sinai.

## What is Sinai?

An internal weekly competition where employees use AI tools to vibe-code internal tools — tools that replace expensive SaaS subscriptions or enhance internal processes, saving the company real money.

---

## Core Module: Project Submissions
- Submit projects with title, description, team/individual, tech stack used, AI tools used
- Record a **short demo video** or upload screenshots directly in-app
- Auto-detect and tag which AI tools were used (Cursor, Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- **Before/After comparison** — what was the old tool/process vs the new vibe-coded solution
- Git repo linking — pull in commit stats, lines of code, time to build

## The Money Shot: Impact Dashboard
- **Cost calculator** — each project logs what tool/service it replaces and the annual cost. Roll it up into a company-wide "Total Saved by Sinai" counter that ticks up in real time like a stock ticker
- **Time saved tracker** — estimate hours saved per week per user, multiply across teams
- **ROI leaderboard** — rank projects by dollars saved, hours saved, adoption rate
- **Executive summary view** — a single page a CEO can look at and immediately see the program's value. Charts, big numbers, trends over time

## Gamification & Competition Engine
- **Weekly leaderboards** with rankings by votes, impact score, creativity
- **Season system** — group weeks into seasons/quarters with overall champions
- **Achievement badges** — "First Submission", "10x Saver" (saved 10x the cost), "Serial Builder" (5 weeks in a row), "Team Player" (collaborated across departments), "AI Polyglot" (used 5+ different AI tools)
- **ELO-style rating system** — projects get rated against each other, builders accumulate a skill rating over time
- **Streak tracking** — consecutive weeks of submissions
- **XP and leveling** — gamify participation itself

## AI-Powered Features
- **AI project summarizer** — paste a repo URL or description, AI generates a polished project card
- **AI impact estimator** — describe what your tool replaces, AI estimates cost/time savings based on market data
- **Smart matching** — "Your project is similar to X built by Team Y last month" to prevent duplicate effort and encourage collaboration
- **AI-generated weekly newsletter** — auto-summarize the week's submissions, winners, stats into a company-wide email/Slack digest
- **Idea generator** — feed in your team's current paid tools and workflows, AI suggests what could be vibe-coded next
- **Sentiment analysis** on feedback/comments

## Knowledge Base & Reuse
- **Project catalog** — searchable archive of every Sinai project ever built
- **Adoption tracker** — after a project wins, track if teams actually adopt it. "Built in Sinai, now used by 3 teams daily"
- **Tech stack trends** — what AI tools and frameworks are people gravitating toward
- **Template library** — winning patterns that others can fork and build on
- **"Request a Tool"** board — anyone in the company can post "I wish someone would build X" and builders can claim requests

## Social & Culture
- **Builder profiles** — portfolio pages showing all your Sinai projects, win rate, total impact
- **Team pages** — see which departments are shipping the most
- **Activity feed** — real-time stream of submissions, votes, comments, achievements
- **Shoutout wall** — give kudos to other builders
- **Hall of Fame** — all-time greatest Sinai projects prominently displayed
- **Rivalry system** — friendly team vs team competition with head-to-head stats

## Live Event Mode
- **Presentation timer** — built-in countdown for demo day
- **Queue manager** — who's presenting next, auto-advance
- **Live dashboard** on a big screen during demo day showing votes streaming in
- **Confetti/celebration animations** when winners are announced

## Analytics & Insights
- **Participation trends** — is engagement growing week over week?
- **Department breakdown** — which teams participate the most/least
- **Tool replacement map** — visual graph of what paid tools have been replaced by Sinai projects
- **Cumulative impact over time** — big line going up and to the right
- **Individual growth tracking** — how builders improve over time

## Integrations
- **Slack bot** — submit projects, vote, get notifications, weekly reminders
- **Calendar integration** — auto-schedule demo days
- **GitHub/GitLab** — auto-pull project stats
- **SSO** — company login

## Why This Wins

1. **It's meta** — using Sinai to build the Sinai tracker is the most on-brand move possible
2. **It sells the program** — the impact dashboard alone justifies the entire Sinai competition to leadership
3. **It has legs** — this isn't a one-week novelty, it becomes essential infrastructure
4. **It showcases AI** — bake AI features into the tool itself to demonstrate what's possible
5. **It drives participation** — gamification and social features create a flywheel
