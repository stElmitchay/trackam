**Raydr** is an open platform where developers submit software projects, connect their GitHub repositories, and receive AI-powered progress analysis that reads their actual source code. Projects earn XP through monthly demo cycles, get evaluated against the Digital Public Goods Standard, and receive actionable next steps with concrete completion criteria. The platform serves both Christex Foundation teams (internal) and the broader developer community.

> 🚧 **Status**: Currently in active development. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community!

## 🌟 Features

### 📊 **AI-Powered Project Analysis**
- **Code-aware analysis**: Reads actual source code diffs, file trees, and key files — not just commit messages. When a commit says "fix stuff" but the diff shows a new authentication system, Raydr detects the real milestone
- **4-stage pipeline**: GitHub data collection → DPG evaluation → Idea evaluation → Synthesis. Each stage builds on the last to produce a complete picture of where a project stands
- **Evidence-based milestones**: Every detected milestone must cite specific files and code changes as evidence. No guessing from commit messages alone

### ✅ **Digital Public Goods Compliance**
- **9-criteria evaluation** against the [DPG Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/), ported from the [christex-foundation/dpg-evaluator](https://github.com/christex-foundation/dpg-evaluator) framework
- **Binary pass/fail per criterion** — no ambiguous numerical scores. Each indicator is either met or not, backed by code evidence
- **"Code over claims" philosophy**: Documentation describing unimplemented features counts *against* the project, not for it
- **Approval likelihood**: 7/9 passing = High, 4-6 = Medium, 0-3 = Low
- **Priority actions**: Ranked list of the most impactful improvements to reach DPG qualification

### 🎯 **Actionable Next Steps**
- **Single source of truth**: All next steps come from the synthesis stage, which has the full picture across idea evaluation, DPG compliance, and progress analysis
- **Concrete completion criteria**: Every step includes a "done when" condition that can be objectively verified (e.g., *"LICENSE file exists in repo root with valid MIT text"*)
- **Evaluation-linked**: Each step tags which specific findings it addresses (e.g., `dpg:criterion-2`, `idea:feasibility`)
- **Persistent until fulfilled**: Unfulfilled steps carry over across analysis cycles — they stay visible until the code shows they're done

### 🛠️ **Implementation Plan Mode**
- **Plan before you push**: Instead of immediately generating code, the "Plan" button generates a reviewable implementation plan — which files to modify, the technical approach, and potential risks
- **Terminal-style plan viewer**: Plans appear inline in a dark, monospace terminal aesthetic with file change indicators (`+` create, `~` update) and risk callouts
- **Approve or reject**: Review the plan, then approve to generate code and open a PR, or reject to discard and try a different approach
- **Plan in the PR**: Approved plans become part of the PR description for traceability

### 💡 **Idea Evaluation**
- **Concept scoring** across 6 dimensions: problem clarity, solution fit, novelty, audience clarity, feasibility, and impact potential
- **Honest assessment**: A vague description scores low on clarity. A clone scores low on novelty. An overambitious scope scores low on feasibility
- **Strengths, concerns, and recommendations** in a structured breakdown

### 🏆 **Gamification & Demo Cycles**
- **XP system**: Earn XP for submitting projects, achieving milestones, fulfilling next steps, and claiming tool requests
- **Monthly demo cycles**: Projects are showcased on the last Thursday of each month with auto-detected Demo Day mode
- **Leaderboards**: Ranked by XP with department and role filtering
- **Streaks**: Track consecutive monthly demo cycle participation
- **Auto-generated newsletters**: Claude summarizes each demo cycle's highlights, top projects, and leaderboard changes

### 🔗 **GitHub Integration**
- **OAuth connection**: Secondary GitHub connection (separate from Supabase auth) for API access
- **Diff-based analysis**: Uses the GitHub compare API to fetch actual code diffs between analyses
- **File tree awareness**: Reads the full repository structure to understand project architecture
- **Key file sampling**: Automatically identifies and reads the most important files (package.json, entry points, configs) for context
- **AI-generated PRs**: Implementation plans that get approved result in branches and pull requests created via the GitHub API

### 👥 **Community**
- **Open to all**: Both Christex Foundation employees (`@christex.foundation` emails auto-tagged as internal) and community developers
- **Project comments**: Threaded discussions on each project
- **Adoption tracking**: Users can "adopt" projects they use, contributing to adoption metrics
- **Builder profiles**: Public profiles with contribution history, XP, level, and department
- **Tool requests**: A bounty board where users request tools and others claim and fulfill them for bonus XP

### 🔐 **Security & Authentication**
- **Supabase Auth**: Server-side session management via `@supabase/ssr` with per-request client creation
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control on all tables
- **Service-role isolation**: Admin operations use a separate service-role client that bypasses RLS
- **GitHub OAuth**: CSRF-protected OAuth flow with state parameter validation

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

### **Frontend Technologies**
- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)**: Svelte 5 with runes (`$state`, `$props`, `$derived`) + TypeScript
- **[Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: Via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin with CSS-based config in `app.css`
- **Editorial dark theme**: Custom design tokens for typography, color, and spacing
- **[`@sveltejs/adapter-auto`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto)**: Automatic deployment adapter

### **Backend & Infrastructure**
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)**: PostgreSQL database, authentication, Row Level Security, storage buckets, and RPC functions
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: Build tool powering the SvelteKit development experience
- **Server-side rendering**: SvelteKit form actions for mutations, `+server.ts` routes for OAuth

### **AI & External APIs**
- **[Claude API](https://docs.anthropic.com/)** (direct fetch, no SDK): Powers progress analysis, DPG evaluation, idea evaluation, synthesis, README generation, newsletter generation, and implementation code generation
- **[GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)** (direct fetch, no Octokit): Repo info, commits, diffs, file tree, file contents, branch creation, and PR creation

## 🔄 How Analysis Works

1. **User clicks "Run Analysis"** on their project page
2. **GitHub data is fetched** in parallel: repo metadata, commit history, code diffs (via compare API), full file tree, and key source files
3. **DPG evaluation** runs against all 9 DPG Standard criteria using detailed per-criterion prompts, evaluating actual code — not documentation claims
4. **Idea evaluation** scores the project concept across 6 dimensions (runs in parallel with DPG)
5. **Progress analysis** reads the actual code diffs to detect milestones, checking each against the previous analysis to avoid double-counting
6. **Synthesis** combines all three evaluations into strengths, critical gaps, and 3-5 prioritized next steps — each with a concrete "done when" condition
7. **Results are stored**: milestones recorded, fulfilled goals marked complete with XP awarded, new next steps added alongside existing unfulfilled ones

## 🛠️ How Implementation Plan Mode Works

1. **User clicks "Plan"** on a next step
2. **AI reads the repo** — fetches the file tree and reads up to 10 relevant files for context
3. **Plan is generated** — which files to modify/create, the technical approach, and potential risks (no code written yet)
4. **Plan appears inline** in a terminal-style viewer below the step
5. **User reviews and decides**:
   - **Approve**: AI generates the actual code changes, creates a branch, commits files, and opens a PR
   - **Reject**: Plan is discarded, step returns to its original state

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers! Here's how to get involved:

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
4. **Make your changes** following existing code conventions
5. **Run `npm run check`** to verify types
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Development Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style and Svelte 5 runes patterns
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep PRs focused and manageable in size
- Update documentation when necessary
